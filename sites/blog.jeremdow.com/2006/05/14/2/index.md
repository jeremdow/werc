Google, disorganized? ...Google?
=========================================

As a footnote to my [last post](http://jere-blog.blogspot.com/2006/05/ms-vs-google-get-your-ticktets-now.html) take a look at this: [Google admits to being disorganized - vnunet.com](http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2155980/google-admits-disorganised)

Well, this is certainly no surprise based on the Press Day product rollouts.

However, such problems simply will not do against Microsoft. Say what you want about MS, if they are anything at all - it's well, organized.
