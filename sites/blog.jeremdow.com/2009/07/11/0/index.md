One more Chrome OS post
=========================================

Now I'm not a great blogger, granted, but I am a long time follower and fan of a preeminent Google watch blog, [Google Operating System](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/). 
 
But really, if the name of your blog is [Google Operating System](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/) - and your stated mission: 
 
 > An unofficial blog that watches Google's attempts to move your operating system online. 
 
And then, after more than five years of dutiful reporting, after all the speculation, it's not [April 1st](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/03/google-browser.html), and Google announces that they are, in fact, actually releasing an operating system... 
 
...and [this is the post](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-chrome-operating-system.html)? 
 
This is level-headed, well-researched, and downright understated - it's journalism - he even points out, and quite right, that [Good OS](http://www.thinkgos.com/index.html) has been gearing up to release an almost identical product called [Cloud](http://woductww.thinkgos.com/cloud/index.html) (there was some buzz about this quite a while ago, though it seems to have been aptly named, still vaporware for now). 
 
But really, all l I can say is good work, Alex, it's just srange to watch the rest of the tech media go crazy while someone familiar with Google's history can so calmly explain the new product. 
 
Am I excited? Of course. I'd bet you are too. 
 
But, is this the end all, come all, end of Microsoft, end of the desktop as we know it? 
 
Not really (or not yet at least).
