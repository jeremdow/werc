Correction...
=========================================

Well, it seems my [last post](http://jere-blog.blogspot.com/2006/05/google-semantic-web.html) was mostly inaccurate - the results [GoogleOS](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/) had discovered are actually a part of the upcoming Google Health as [ZDNet.com](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/index.php?p=183) and others are now reporting (although any links to preview the service seem now to be non-functional).

Disappointing - in two ways, actually. Most were hoping Google Health would be a little more robust - and personally I still think Google needs to offer some query refinement options in the general web search. Much is already in place - from maps to word definitions, simple math, and now health - but a broader "Semantic Web" is still very much in need.
