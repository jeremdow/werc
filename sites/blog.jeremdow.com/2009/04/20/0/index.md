Oracle/Sun Analysis
=========================================

I'm mostly concerned about MySQL, disappointed the IBM deal fell through, and sorry I didn't own any JAVA stock this morning. 
 
Nonetheless, [Om's analysis](http://gigaom.com/2009/04/20/oracle-to-buy-sun-for-74-billion/) is the one I found the most thoughtful/informative, although not all that reassuring.
