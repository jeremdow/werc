Orion + Voice = Star Trek?
=========================================

[John Battelle](http://feeds.feedburner.com/JohnBattellesSearchblog?m=1359) at least jokes that it might be.

Google received a patent on April 12 for a voice interface for search. They even have an offline version of a demo available [here](http://labs1.google.com/gvs.html).

That alone would be good enough for maps and other information over your mobile phone and pretty much make "411" obsolete.

But, they have also acquired and begun work on improving Ori Allon's [Orion](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-09/uons-nse090605.php) technology.

Hmm... so you query Google verbally, Google scours the web for all relevant information, Orion compiles that information into a single document, a computer reads that document to you...

Call [Majel Barrett](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000854/) - this sucker's ready to go online!

(well, maybe almost)
