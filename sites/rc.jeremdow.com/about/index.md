About this site
================

This site was built on [werc](http://werc.cat-v.org), a minimalist, database free "web-anti-framework" written for the rc shell leveraging the standard Unix/Plan 9 command toolkit.

An [online repository](http://gsoc.cat-v.org/hg/werc/) and full documentation are available from the author's [project page](http://werc-cat-v.org).

You can also [browse](http://git.jeremdow.com/?p=jeremdow.com.git) my own configuration or get a copy of this site's repository using [Git](http://git-scm.com) with the following command:

	git clone http://git.jeremdow.org/jeremdow.com.git

This site was based on the [suckless.org werc setup](http://werc.cat-v.org/wiki/suckless/) in the wiki and a small [modification to the blagh app](http://git.jeremdow.com/?p=jeremdow.com.git;a=blobdiff;f=apps/blagh/app.rc;h=6ccff7db772483246b3547ff08b953d0462f6db0;hp=71bcef6a0e2cf966ff71d6d22a07ba5535b652df;hb=3d8551ceb7385d142107adc460965e4ba8b717bd;hpb=2ef2e30503668e627c2e3d4f6bc8442ec9a9acb7).

## Why not Drupal?

Drupal is an amazing framework; I use it every day. It's flexible and powerful, but comes with a certain degree of complexity, albeit nessesary (most of it).

Werc is a reminder of the elegance of simplicity.
