[Google's War on Hierarchy, and the Death of Hierarchical Folders - - Microcontent News, a Corante.com Microblog](http://www.microcontentnews.com/articles/deathofhierarchy.htm)

Pretty interesting article that sets up the struggle between Microsoft and Google as a war between "hierarchy" and "search".

Good stuff.
