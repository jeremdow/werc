Google Updates Video
=========================================

[Google Video](http://video.google.com/) this week added a long awaited uploader - both a [web](http://video.google.com/videouploadform) and [downloadable application](https://upload.video.google.com/UploadInfo) version to make it easier for users to upload their own videos to its service.

[Google remains in third place](http://www.informationweek.com/industries/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=187900411), however, lagging behind both [MSN](http://video.msn.com/) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/) - and still lacks key partnerships needed to draw users with premium content.
