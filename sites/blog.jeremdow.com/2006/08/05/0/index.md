It's been a while...
=========================================

Wow, [June 6th](http://jere-blog.blogspot.com/2006/06/google-spreadsheets-surprise.html)... That was a while back... (2 months, exactly) Man... [Google Spreadsheets](http://spreadsheets.google.com/) turned out to be a big disappointment too... (although I still use it - very useful for storing important info online - sort of a GDrive Lite if you will...) Anyhoo, if you have missed my posts as of late, I do apologize, I tentatively plan to get back on schedule next week. -Oh yeah, and if anyone actually DID miss [Jere's Blog](http://jere-blog.blogspot.com/) (besides me) leave me some comments - I could use the encouragement.
