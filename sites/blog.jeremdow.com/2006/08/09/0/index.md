Google Video Bumps Froogle
=========================================

Wow - [Google](http://www.google.com) finally re-worked the main search page to highlight [Video](http://video.google.com/)! 

I guess the [MTV deal](http://www.vnunet.com/computing/news/2161932/google-mtv) must have put it over the edge...

But, what about poor [Froogle](http://froogle.google.com/), who lost their link?

Not to worry - they also equipped the more link with a slick little in-line ajax window linking to [Froogle](http://froogle.google.com/), [Groups](http://groups.google.com/), and the all new (law suits pending) [Book Search](http://books.google.com/)!

Way to go, Google! Now pimp that [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/) so that I have someone else to chat with...
