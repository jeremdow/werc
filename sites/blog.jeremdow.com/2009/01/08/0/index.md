Windows 7 Beta Tommorrow
=========================================

From the [Windows blog](http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windows7/archive/2009/01/07/information-on-downloading-and-installing-windows-7-beta.aspx) -
 > On January 9th, the Windows 7 Beta will be available for Windows enthusiasts to download via the Windows 7 page on Windows.com. The Windows 7 Beta is going to be available download-only (weâ€™re not sending out physical media) and available for a limited time to the first 2.5 million people who download the beta. 

First 2.5 million - and no actual time I can find yet - so keep an eye out and get a jump on it, I guess.

I'm holding out some hope for this Windows - actually quite looking forward to trying it tomorrow.
