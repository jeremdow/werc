About this site
================

This site runs on [werc](http://werc.cat-v.org). Werc is a minimalist, database free CMS, so-called "web-anti-framework", written using the rc shell and standard Unix/Plan 9 command toolkit.

An [online repository](http://gsoc.cat-v.org/hg/werc/) and full documentation are available from the author's [project page](http://werc-cat-v.org).

You can also [browse](http://git.jeremdow.com/?p=jeremdow.com.git) my own configuration or get a copy of this site's repository using [Git](http://git-scm.com) with the following command:

	git clone http://git.jeremdow.org/jeremdow.com.git

My configuration was based on the [Suckless.org werc setup](http://werc.cat-v.org/wiki/suckless/) in the wiki.

## Why not Drupal?

Drupal is an amazing framework; I use it every day. It's flexible and powerful, but comes with a certain degree of complexity, albeit nessesary (most of it).

Werc is a reminder of the elegance of simplicity.
