SkypeOut - Free calls to phones until 2007
=========================================

The popular VOIP software [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) plans to offer free calling to phones, a feature normally reserved for its paid subscribers, anywhere in North America until the end of this year. This is certainly going to be a huge draw for users, as it is generally regarded as Skype's most attractive feature (notably lacking in competitive products, such as [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/)) and as ZDNet's Russell Shaw jokes - [What's next? - Paying callers to use it?](http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=1090) As competition heats up in the VOIP field, Google seems to be lagging behind. Despite securing a high profile contract with Nokia on its new [770 Internet Tablet](http://www.nokia.com/770/), it has yet to announce plans to offer either calling to phones, or video conferencing - both long standing Skype features - to its VOIP offering. And honestly, what good is the Nokia 770 going to be if it can only call other Googlers? [](http://www.technewsworld.com/story/50521.html)
