Google Music?
=========================================

I've been slacking on the posts lately - and amid a flurry of Google activity - expect to see this remedied very soon.

Before I delve into press day, all of the other speculation, and my general disappointment (yeah, you heard me) with Google as of late - I just wanted to throw this up for discussion purposes.

So, Google Music? [Garrett Rogers' mysterious Muze](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/index.php?p=189) (an anonymous source) says yes.

Actually, if it's true (and whether or not Muze is a Google employee, I'd say the iTunes dominated music market is pretty hard to ignore - even for Google) this would be the first example of an actually exciting offering from the Googleplex in quite a while.

"Me-Too" or not, some "information" that nearly everyone seems to want to organize and access is their favorite songs, music videos, and TV shows (growing even faster than expected) - [Google Video](http://video.google.com/) and Music (or Tunes or whatever it is) better sign some more deals and beef up their content (Brady Bunch and ST:Voyager for $1.99?) - maybe even buy an ad or two (wouldn't that be something?) - or risk being churned up in Apple's wake.

If I was Google, I'd even consider teaming up with the now struggling [Napster](http://www.napster.com/) - when I think Google, "Geeks" comes to mind long before "Tunes" - Google could benefit from whatever street cred the Napster brand still carries.

As for Napster, the only thing that might be even more ubiquitous than the iPod is the Google search page - if Napster can't sell songs there, well...
