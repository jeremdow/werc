Windows Live - Beta
=========================================

Everyone who hasn't checked [this](http://www.live.com/) out, should. It's "beta" in the conventional sense - not the Google sense where it's kickass but will stay in beta for three years anyway - or the traditional microsoft sense where your mouse explodes or something. I signed up for the mail - but it looks like there's at least a month wait - if they decide you're eligible at all - on who knows what basis...
