Orion goes to Google
=========================================

Google out bids rivals Yahoo and MSN and [steps up its search technology](http://news.ft.com/cms/s/f62dea50-c8dd-11da-b642-0000779e2340.html) with [Orion](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050909220825.htm), a patented algorithm for displaying search results directly in the search window rather than requiring the user to "click through" to the actual page.

And as a bonus, the software's creator, 26-year-old PhD student, Ori Allon, has put down stakes at the Googleplex to optimize his code for the big time.

This is a huge loss for Bill Gates who, after personally praising the software and it's creator on multiple occasions, now ends up losing the bid.
