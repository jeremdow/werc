Next Generation - Analysis: The Rise and Fall of Franchises
=========================================

[Slashdot](http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/05/1338222&from=rss) also has a link to this, but I wanted to say a little more about Next Gen's [analysis](http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2672&amp;amp;Itemid=2&limit=1&limitstart=0):

They spend more time on their general theory of the evolution of games than they do on the death of any franchises. On the franchise predictions: sure movie franchises will sink once the movie's have been on DVD for a year or so, and yes GTA and Tony Hawk are getting stale, this is obvious stuff...

On their general theory - I disagree with both of their premises - firstly that the evolution of gaming is a march towards realism - it has been since the "next generation" consoles - but wasn't to start with (pac man and space invaders had nothing to do with realism) - and won't be forever -

Graphics will progress to photo realism, surely, but then what? The market may snap up cinematic games with photo-realistic graphics just like they scarf blockbuster movies all summer - but surely developers can do more with this medium than choose-your-own-adventure movies.

On the progression to online - not all games are good online games. That doesn't make them bad games. Gaming isn't a sport (or shouldn't only be) - it's also an artform - and like a good novel, some forms of it will always be best enjoyed individually, or at least non-competitively.
