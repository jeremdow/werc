XP on an Intel Mac?
=========================================

Personally, I'd prefer the option to run OSX on my PC - but Boot Camp does make a pretty enticing offer. Check out [CNet's article](http://www.cnet.com.au/games/0,39029232,40061763,00.htm) on the viability of an Intel based Mac gaming platform. I'm probably one of the few people who actually use a PC at home and a Mac for work - but there are many times that I find myself wondering why I stick with Windows at all. The answer of course is software support - going well beyond just gaming - so the potential for a dual boot G5 (is it still a G5 with Intel inside?) with an Apple cinema display for gaming sounded almost too good to be true. ...then I remembered the price tag.
