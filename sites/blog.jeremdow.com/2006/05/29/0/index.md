This is a graph of my blog created by "[Websites as graphs](http://www.aharef.info/static/htmlgraph/)" - another project by the same guy who is selling the "[1,000 paintings](http://www.onethousandpaintings.com/home/)" of the numbers 1 - 1,000. That project's a little avant garde for my tastes... I love the website graphs though.
