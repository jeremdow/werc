Can open source replace Crystal Reports?
=========================================

Some companies are considering replacing solutions like [Crystal Reports](http://www.businessobjects.com/solutions/crystalreports/default.asp) and [Actuate](http://www.actuate.com/products/enterprisereporting/reporting.asp) with their open source counterparts. [Slashdot | Are Open Source Reporting Tools Ready for Primetime?](http://ask.slashdot.org/askslashdot/06/03/08/2259203.shtml) Is this another victory for the linux crowd, or is it too soon to tell?
