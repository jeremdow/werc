Werc is working
====================

This blog is finally in werc! I wrote a [little script](http://git.jeremdow.com/?p=bin.git;a=blob;f=wordpress-export) to convert all my wordpress archives, and just finally getting things in order enough to publish. So far so good, clean and fast. I've been working on the [blagh app](http://git.jeremdow.com/?p=jeremdow.com.git;a=history;f=apps/blagh/app.rc) and some other patches to get a little better presentation and maybe work in a few bells and whistles.

I'm also staring to maintain my personal projects in git and host them publicly with gitosis and gitweb. My repositories will be available at [git.jeremdow.com](http://git.jeremdow.com/). I'm especially happy with the matching header and stylesheet for gitweb, ties things together nicely.
